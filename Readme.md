## Boolean Search Engine

<ul>
  <li>In this project I first design my own inverted index to map terms to documents.</li>
  <li>In an inverted index, each token points to a list of documents that it is present in. It provides a fast and efficient search.</li>
  <li>The list of documents for each term are ranked using TF-IDF ranking for providing best search results</li> 
  <li>I then make use of this inverted index to build a Boolean Search Engine in Python3 that returns results to a Boolean query.</li>
</ul>
